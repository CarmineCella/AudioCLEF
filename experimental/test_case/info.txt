These results have been obtained by computing spectral clustering on the minibird dataset.
Classes 22 and 140 appear to be close (number 2 and 6 in the plot) so I took
the files

LIFECLEF2014_BIRDAMAZON_XC_WAV_RN11846.wav
LIFECLEF2014_BIRDAMAZON_XC_WAV_RN400.wav

each one belonging to one class and compared. The wav file in this folder
shows how the two classes are similar after having acceleretad and transposed
one of the two classes.
